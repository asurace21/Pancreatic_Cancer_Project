### Overview of Machine Learning Model



### Description of preliminary data preprocessing

Preprocessing for the data included dropping unnecessary columns (sample_id, patient_cohort, sample_origin, plasma_CA19_9, benign_sample_diagnosis), dropping null values from REG1B and REG1A, and checking the data types of the remaining columns. Object datatypes were then converted to int64 by use of OneHotEncoder. These new data type columns were then merged back into the original dataframe.
