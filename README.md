# Pancreatic_Cancer_Project

## Overview

For this project we will be analyzing the urine test results of individuals who participated in a pancreatic cancer clinical study, published in 2020. Previously, there were thought to be three essential urinary biomarkers, used in a panel, to help identify and diagnose pancreatic cancer. This study aims to validate the use of a fourth  biomarker, in order to make the panel more efficient. Our goal is to use the data to test if adding the fourth biomarker, in fact,  makes the panel more accurate. Through the use of tableau and unsupervised machine learning, we will be able to predict and differentiate, with a higher level of confidence, which individuals have pancreatic cancer (and what stage), as well as, those who have non-cancerous pancreatic conditions compared to healthy individuals.
