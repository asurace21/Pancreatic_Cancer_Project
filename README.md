# Pancreatic_Cancer_Project

## Overview

For this project we will be analyzing the urine test results of individuals who participated in a pancreatic cancer clinical study, published in 2020. Previously, there were thought to be three essential urinary biomarkers, used in a panel, to help identify and diagnose pancreatic cancer. This study aims to validate the use of a fourth  biomarker, in order to make the panel more efficient. Our goal is to use the data to test if adding the fourth biomarker in fact makes the panel more accurate. Through the use of supervised machine learning we will be able to predict and differentiate, with a higher level of confidence, which individuals have pancreatic cancer (and what stage), as well as those who have non-cancerous pancreatic conditions compared to healthy individuals. We will then visualize our results in a Tableau dashboard.

## Data Exploration

The data set for this project came from Kaggle in the form of a csv file providing levels of four urinary biomarkers, as well as creatinine and blood plasma levels, for British and Spanish patients falling into one of three groups: control group, patients with benign hepatobiliary conditions, and patients with pancreatic cancer. We stored this data in a database using pgAdmin. For the initial stages of data exploration, we created summary tables showing average levels of the markers for patients across different genders, diagnosis groups, and stages of cancer. These tables were later used to make summary bar graphs using the Python Pyplot library.
