The source data shows urinary markers found in samples taken from 590 patients with either a pancreatic cancer diagnosis or a more benign pancreatic condition. 

The structure of the database is as follows:

sample_id PK charvar
patient_cohort charvar
sample_origin charvar
age int
sex varchar
diagnosis int
stage varchar
benign_sample_diagnosis varchar
plasma_CA19_9 int
creatinine int
LYVE1 int
REG1B int
TFF1 int
REG1A int

The database will integrate with the machine learning model by creating additional datasets for the model through SQL querying. 
The initial machine learning model will work on the entire dataset, but subsequent models can be created for certain diagnoses or subsets of the population.
