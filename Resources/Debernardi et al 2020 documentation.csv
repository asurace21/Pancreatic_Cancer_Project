benign_sample_diagnosis,Benign Samples Diagnosis,"For those with a benign, non-cancerous diagnosis, what was the diagnosis?"
plasma_CA19_9,Plasma CA19-9 U/ml,Blood plasma levels of CA 19–9 monoclonal antibody that is often elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer. Only assessed in 350 patients (one goal of the study was to compare various CA 19-9 cutpoints from a blood sample to the model developed using urinary samples).

REG1B,REG1B ng/ml,Urinary levels of a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration.
TFF1,TFF1 ng/ml,"Urinary levels of Trefoil Factor 1, which may be related to regeneration and repair of the urinary tract"
REG1A,REG1A ng/ml,Urinary levels of a protein that may be associated with pancreas regeneration. Only assessed in 306 patients (one goal of the study was to assess REG1B vs REG1A)
